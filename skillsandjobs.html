     <h2> Programmer </h2>
<p> In this context a programmer will be responsible for using scripting languages to create the framework for a game. Personal skills that are invaluable for this role include creativity in order to discover unique methods to adapt this concept into a full-fledged game, communication and teamwork to effectively work with the other individuals involved in this project and problem-solving to overcome any potential setbacks within the project. While not necessary a passion of video games and their development is also incredibly valuable. Knowledge of scripting languages such as Python and C++ as well as experience with game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine are vital. </p>

<h2> Designer</h2>
<p>The main role of a designer in this case is to dictate the direction of and refine the adaptation of a game concept in areas such as interface, level design, maps, and other areas. The personal skills are largely the same as a programmer with an emphasis on communication and teamwork. Knowledge of and experience with both game engines and scripting languages are also vital here.  </p>
	
<h2> Artist</h2>
<p> The job of an artist is to develop the visual elements of a game in the form of 2D and 3D objects such as characters and textures. The personal skills necessary here are largely the same as above with a major emphasis on creativity. An artist should be familiar with editing software such as Photoshop and Aftereffects and should possess experience with game engines. Knowledge and/or experience with scripting languages is also incredibly valuable. </p>
	
	  <h2> Producer</h2>
<p> A producer is responsible for overseeing the development of the project whilst tending to its financial and business aspects. In addition to the personal skills listed above with an emphasis being placed on communication, leadership and project management are also vital to succeed. Within this role marketing and economics are imperative, particularly within budgeting and pitching to a potential publisher.  </p>
