<h1> Group Processes and Communication </h1>

<p> 
Especially due to the fact that this class is primary online, communication is a vital factor for a group to produce a success product and report. As stated previously our group wasn’t the prime example of excellent communication, this made us discover how vital it is for a group to work effectively. We utilised time during and after our workshop to gather our thoughts and discuss what we will be doing for the week, this was done via Microsoft teams. In between this week we would communicate frequently in a Discord chat and Microsoft teams chat when necessary. When a member of the group isn’t involved in group discussion or doesn’t appear in calls as frequently as we would like we would message the individual in chat listing what needs to be done and by when. This is completed to ensure that each member is always fully aware on what needs to be done so nobody falls behind. Overall, our communication has improved drastically, and every member is aware of the expectations and time limits on hand.
