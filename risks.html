<p>Game engine. What if the game engine we use has bugs that affect the fluency of the game? This is a common problem in many excellent FPS games. This will prevent players from experiencing the important experience we are trying to create for them. So, our group decided to add game content step by step when making the game, instead of adding a lot of things at one time. The advantage is that when we find that the game doesn't work properly, we can modify it quickly instead of waiting for everything to be finished.  </p>
<p>Game content design. Because our time is limited, if we decide to add too much content, it is very likely that our team will not be able to complete the project before the delivery time, and we need to make subtle adjustments to the game in the later stage, so our content needs to be concise and practical.  </p>
<p>Interest. Because our game is just an aiming training game, players shoot at the target in a map. So, we don't think this game will bring a lot of fun to players.
