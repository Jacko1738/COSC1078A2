Software / tools required during this project are GitHub, Unity Version 2020.2.3f1 and programming languages like HTML, CSS and C#. For commercial use Unity requires you to purchase the pro version so if this project idea were to develop into a full fledge application buying it would be required. Almost any device can utilise GitHub however for Unity you may require a slightly beefier device depending on what youâ€™re doing (simple UI or baking 3D scenes) and supports Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; Mac OS X 10.12+; Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, and CentOS 7. GitHub allows for the collaborating on projects which makes it easy for a group to work on a website in our case and Unity is an excellent platform for making applications and is very beginner friendly with the number of tutorials online. Our group has all got experience from assignment 1 and 2 on using GitHub and the programming languages: HTML and CSS. The member of our group: Jack has had previous experience with Unity and coding with the C# language from previous projects in previous years making it easy to make our project demo.
