<h1> Plans and Progress </h1>


<div id="bodytext"
<p> 
Our project is to make a 1v1 FPS aim-training game in the same vein as CS: GO, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege and Fortnite. This application will feature different modes such as first person and third person and game modes that replicate other games such as the ones listed above as well as a variety of different weapons. 
</p>
	<p> Our motivation for creating an aim-trainer is to provide an easy and enjoyable method to improve aim. The FPS genre has become one of the most popular game types for players all over the world. According to the survey, among the top 10 most popular games in 2021, FPS games account for six. </p>
	<p>Players like FPS games is that FPS can bring people a realistic feeling. Some game manufacturers combine FPS games with history, allowing players to enjoy FPS games and showcase real historical stories to players, bringing them back to World War I and World War II, such as Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5. Muscle memory and other skills that contribute to overall aim can developed through specialised tests such as range, aim endurance and reaction speed.  </p>
	<p> Of course, the charm of FPS game is far more than that, the competition between players is the key. Starting from CS1.5, FPS game has been applied to LAN technology for the first time, which enables real-life players to compete and compare their reaction ability, aiming ability and judgment ability. Now, FPS game has a huge number of players. Maybe most of them just regard the game as a way of entertainment, but some people want to practice superb technology in the game. Now FPS games have joined the ranking system, and players are willing to spend time improving technology in order to improve their ranking on the system That's why we want to make a targeted training game. We hope that the players who love FPS can get faster technical improvement. </p>
	<p>In the process, we investigated two existing aiming training games.   </p>
	<h2>Aimboost </h2>
	<p> Aimbooster is a free aiming training game. The function and operation mode of the software are very simple and practical. It can simulate the shooting operation by moving the mouse, and then shoot the yellow dot target that appears constantly. Although it is free, it can only be displayed in a 2D interface, which is not a good choice for most 3D shooting games. Because in 3D games, the size of the enemy model will change according to the distance between players, that is, the farther the distance is, the smaller the target will be. </p>
	<h2> Aim Hero </h2>
	<p> Aimhero is another targeting training game. It's very popular with FPS players on steam, you can download it for $4.99. This game is developed by unity. It has comprehensive content. You can download some classic maps, such as dust2. </p>
	<p> Here are many different game modes. Simple aim training. This allows players to start aiming training anywhere on the map. You can use some common maps, and then the enemy will appear in different ways, such as moving left and right, or jumping. Penta kill training. Players need to shoot five enemies with five bullets. Strafing target training. Players need to shoot a moving object on an open map. The more times they hit, the higher the score. </p>
	<p> We think Aimbooster and Aimhero are both good aiming training shooting games, and we intend to combine them. We plan to use Aim booster's practice mode to shoot at the target and we will use Unity to make our project, to make the whole game have better picture performance than 2D. </p>

	<h2> Reasons behind choosing Unity <h2>
<p> First, it has a wide range of applications. All creators, including game development, art, architecture, car design, film and television, turn their creativity into reality with the help of unity. The supporting platforms include mobile phone, tablet computer, PC, game console, augmented reality and virtual reality devices. These just show that the strength and application scope of unity is huge and reliable. </p>
	<p>Second, unity is recognized by creators and users from all over the world. Unity has been installed more than 37 billion times in 2019. More than half of all games on the whole platform (including PC / game console / mobile device) are created with unity, and 53% of the top 1000 games on Apple App store and Google play are created with unity. The most amazing thing is that the average monthly downloads of games and experiences based on unity are as high as 3 billion times.  </p>
	<p>Third, unity has the same creative concept as ours. Unity's business philosophy is ‘unity believes that the world will become better with more creators.’ This coincides with our project concept. Our project is to let more FPS users learn advanced skills faster and more efficiently. Let users get better game experience!  </p>
	<p>Unity provides very useful tools for making applications from scratch. Unity provides many assets that the developer can use to create their game, ranging from UI to 3D world objects. Our project utilised a popular FP controller from the asset store which provided a good base for the project. Unity makes it easy to implement ideas as it does the hard part for you, by eliminating the tedious process of making your own engine for 3D or 2D development.  </p>
	<p>And fortunately, one of our team members has the experience of using Unity, which makes our progress more smoothly and avoids us spending more time learning to use a new game development software. From previous projects he can write scripts for major components of the project demo. Including shooting targets, respawning random targets on a plane, counting variables including how many shots hit targets, timers, sensitivity, field of view, etc and components of the UI (toggling UI, making buttons and sliders work).   </p>
	<p>In order to complete the project, our team divided the work among each person, and each person was responsible for completing different parts. This is to avoid everyone facing the same problem. We don't want to discuss only one problem in every week's meeting, which will make a simple problem spend a lot of time. So, the way we choose is that everyone is responsible for different problems, and then we put forward the problems that everyone has encountered in the weekly meeting, and then we give solutions and good ideas together.  </p>
	
	
	<h2> Our Project </h2>
	<p>In the process of making the whole project, we try our best to make our project more perfect. Every member of our team has a very good idea. We hope to add more functions to our aiming training game, such as adding game maps and different game modes. But because our time is limited, it is difficult for us to include all the functions, so we choose to keep the most basic aiming training, that is, shooting at objects in different positions. Because it will test the player's reaction ability and aiming ability, which is also the requirement for a professional player.  </p>
	<p>Our initial structure of the game is to shoot a ball target, and when the target is hit, the ball will appear in another position randomly. At the beginning, we built the basic model for the game, set up the scene or map, and implementing functions such as knowing when the target is has got shot and respawning targets at random positions.  </p>
	<p>In the 1.0 version, we added a simple pistol model from the Unity asset store which provided the model and gun animations. We also added a score system to the game that presented the scores in the lower left corner. After a period of testing, we realized that a simple framework is not enough. We need to add more settings to make the project more appropriate to the FPS game.  </p>
	<p>In the 1.1 version, we added new settings to the game. Players can now adjust FOV, sensitivity, target size, and target span distance. And players can now move and shoot at targets from different positions. And solidifying basic UI such as start and pause screens and displaying a 30 second timer.  </p>
	<p>Finalizing the game resulting in testing / bug fixing which presented problems like no way to exit the game and UI glitches (not showing up). These were fixed and built into the final prototype. So far, we are going very well. Our training game on Unity has been completed. Now we need to add more details to our report.  </p>
