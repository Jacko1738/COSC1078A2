<p> Dylan: The group overall was easy to work with, everyone completing their delegated tasks on time. During the beginning of the assignment, we were all collectively slow to jump onto the assignment and create calls and communicate which could be improved. But as we progressed further into the assignment the group began to pick up some speed and we began to finalise our project idea and delegate large amounts work to each other. The use of Microsoft teams and discord allowed us to message each other about any questions in relation to the task, with each question came a response from another member. One thing that was surprising was how we all had a solid amount of knowledge regarding FPS games. One thing that I have learned about groups is that in the beginning it can be difficult to communicate (due to being online) but as time passes, we develop more chemistry which overall results in more work quality work being completed. We split up the work regarding making the website and making the document presentable, I was involved in creating the website overall by providing the skeleton. </p>
	<p>Tenghui: We are a huge group with six members. In this group, I think everything is going well, except that we sometimes can't find time to hold meetings together, which means lack of effective communication, but later we gradually get used to this learning mode (online). Everyone in the group will be very serious to complete their division of labor, and willing to answer questions and give help. What we can improve is that everyone should learn to allocate time more reasonably, because we have a lot of homework to submit in week8, so the time spent in it is reduced. What surprised me was that my English was not very good, but my team members were willing to listen. I encountered problems in GitHub in the process, and my team members patiently provided help. It makes me feel very lucky and surprised. Everyone is very friendly. Also, each team member provided effective suggestions for our work and project. In terms of GitHub, everyone in our group works very hard. Dylan provides a framework for the group, and then each member is responsible for submitting their part to the GitHub website instead of letting one person complete all the work. Therefore, I learned that teamwork is very important, which makes a huge job easier, and can understand other people's ideas and learn new knowledge. </p>	
<p> Ethan: Within the group it was easy after we sorted everything out. I feel like communication could have been a bit clearer. We couldn’t have our meetings as often because sometimes people had stuff on when scheduled, other assignments and couldn’t/forgot to communicate. One thing that was surprising is everyone being able to understand the aspect on the FPS game. This allowed us to complete our work and provide different kind of insights on the game. The group could offer different ideas to help improve the game. I learned that groups online are extremely hard to be involved in. Sometimes there was technological problems that couldn’t be fixed, this could have removed some peoples impacts on the project. Not being able to talk to each other in person and meet up and complete the work online had an impact on not being able to do tasks as easily.  I feel like a face-to-face group assignment would have been easier to delegate and complete the task on time. The GitHub repository has everyone putting their own information in that was delegated to them. Some of the GitHub logs cannot accurately show the impact due to technological issues outside of our control.  This has caused to other people needing to put peoples information onto the repository  </p>
	<p>Mitchell: The best aspect of the project was the delegation of roles as the tasks at hand were designed in a way that they could be split up, allowing work to be performed efficiently and with little risk of clashing that could be derived from multiple people working on a single piece of information. One aspect that could be improved is communication. Our communication channels took place on multiple platforms being Discord and Microsoft Teams which required both to be monitored to be up to date, it was especially easy to fall behind if meetings were missed due to a lack of written information. This also made retrieval of written information difficult due to the existence of two different channels which would require going through both, an obvious solution is to restrict communication to a single channel. I was surprised how amicable and easy my teammates were to work with, even with my frequent absences. I was apprehensive about working in a team due to my preference for individualism, but they helped make this project a rather pleasant experience. An apparent benefit of working in this group was the variety of ideas that were placed forth before our project was finalised which helped expand my scope and perspective on what is possible within such a project.  </p>
	<p> Luke: With a group of 6 we worked really well with each other after we got it all sorted out communication wise and what work each member would be doing.  When we decided which section each of us were doing was when we started to really kick off as a group and get the job done. An improvement that could have been made was figuring out communication earlier on as we had some issues with teams notifications but once we figured It out, we all were communicating well and working well as a team. One thing that was surprising was that we had a lot of hiccups along the way with communication and sorting out what each member was going to be doing but as soon as the hiccups were overcome, it was really good to see how fast we all worked and how much we ended up collaborating seeing the start we had. One thing that I learnt about groups is that it was good how each person of the group had their own strengths which in the end worked really well together which I believe helped the whole group in completing the assignment effectively. All member of the group has actively added and contributed to the addition and change of both the word doc and the GitHub repo.  </p>
