<h1> Project Overview </h1>


<div id="bodytext"
     <h2> Topic </h2>
<p> 
The concept of the project is to create a program with the intent of improving aim within the FPS genre. This concept will be realised in the form of a 1v1 aim trainer to provide an enjoyable experience of developing aim. The program will contain multiple modes such as first person and third person as well as game modes that represent other FPS games such CSGO. There will be multiple types of weapons available and additionally there will also be an online mode with an accompanying leaderboard. These aspects all culminate to a simplistic method of improving aim. These ideas will be made tangible using Unity to create a prototype and Figma to create the game’s interface. With Figma the overall interface and aesthetic can be showcased while Unity can demonstrate the raw gameplay aspects as maps and settings. 
</p>
	<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> The motivation behind this project is the amount of experience each member has with fps games in general. We didn’t want the passion and knowledge that we all possessed for FPS games to go unused, so we decided to decide upon a project that was within the realm of gaming. The overall experience each member had on shooters encourage us to come to the final decision to create a game that can improve the aim and muscle memory of players across all popular shooters. The current market for this type of game may be minimal but the quality is high. Popular games such as CSGO, Valorant and Rainbow Six Siege continuously drawing in new players the market for new players wanting to improve at their respected game is high. This acted as another motivator as we wanted to use our experience from all the aim trainers and implement our own to produce the “perfect” aim trainer. We wanted to introduce another aim trainer that differentiates itself from the market by introducing different modes and ranking systems that link with your respected game. </p>

	<h2> Landscape </h2>
<p> There are currently games within the aim trainer game market, these games can be accessed via steam and draw in many users due to their respected unique features. One of most popular aim trainers is “Aim Lab” due to it being extremely high quality, features and the fact that it is free. This game offers many different types of modes and caters training for almost every type of situation that may occur in any game. It also offers many statistics on your overall performance. Another aim trainer that took over the market in recent months is Logitech's “PLAYERMASTER” which focuses mainly on the CSGO market. PLAYMASTER can give a deep insight into an individual's reaction time and accuracy by comparing them directly to all other players. Other games such as Aimtastic and 3D Aim Trainer are also games that offer large amounts of levels and features for the user. Our project would not only offer these features but allow more chances to customise the game to cater the user, this would mainly be in the skin's aspect of the game.  </p>
