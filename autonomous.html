<h1> Autonomous Vehicles </h1>


<div id="bodytext"
     <h2> What does it do?</h2>
<p> Autonomous vehicles can often be confused alongside automated and self-driving vehicles. An autonomous vehicle is a piece of machinery that is capable of being fully self-aware and can make its own decisions. A full automated car requires orders first before completed the drive. A self-driving car can drive in any situation but still needs a human present at the wheel to monitor all tasks. Self-driving cars are the ones that are seen on the roads today which have been produced by companies such as Telsa. An autonomous vehicle relies on many different pieces of equipment including various sensors, machine learning systems and powerful processors. Autonomous cars scan the environment and create a map of their surroundings, gathering information on other cars, traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians. Lidar and Ultrasonic sensors are used to assist the car in day-to-day travel, these sensors allow the car to develop an idea on the distance from objects around it. Alongside the hardware is complicated software that ultimately makes all the decisions such as the speed to travel, when to turn and even what to do in dangerous situations. Developments in more advanced sensors, cameras and transfer of data will further encourage the advancement of autonomous vehicles. Currently more and more companies are adapting various sensors into their own cars to help the driver when driving, basic features such as adaptative cruise control or self-reverse parking are feature that have become more common in consumer vehicles. There are 5 levels of driving automation, as each level progresses the vehicle becomes less reliant on the human to perform tasks. Current consumer autonomous cars developed by companies such as Telsa currently full under level 2. This level means the car can complete basic tasks but without 100% guarantee and with the need of human assistance. Development is currently underway in various locations around the globe on autonomous vehicles that will fall under level 5 but isn't expected to reach the market for at least a few more years. The highest level a car has achieved that is available on the market is the Honda Legend which received a level 3. Cars aren’t the own type of vehicle that has become full autonomous, developments have been made that allow autonomous trains, buses, tractors and planes. Autonomous tractors have changed the way people farm as they can complete basic tasks without the assistance of a driver as they use the GPS and other wireless technologies.   </p>
	<h2> What is the likely impact?</h2>
	<p>Autonomous cars will drastically change the way society can move from different destinations. Autonomous vehicles will reduce overall fatal accidents on the road due to a high percentage of accidents are caused by human error. Hypothetically if all cars were autonomous, they would be able to communicate with each other and move together at a constant speed which would eliminate all traffic congestion. The chances of car accidents will not only decrease but so will the air pollution, with majority of autonomous vehicles being equip with fully electric motors. The amount of pollution that is currently generated from the worlds vehicles is becoming high with it having negative effects on the plan.  Autonomous vehicles wouldn’t even consist of any pedals or steering wheels due to the advanced ability of the vehicle so no human interaction would be required. Other autonomous vehicles such as trains, buses, tractors and planes can affect how previous tasks will be accomplished.  An enhancement of this technology will have great effect on people's jobs, drivers and farmers jobs would become redundant as the technology would be advanced enough to drive to and from locations with the ability to constantly adapt to the environment around them. All drivers in public transport such as bus and train drivers would not be needed as the vehicles will be capable of driving themselves. Planes could also fly to and from destinations when the technology becomes advanced enough. While this may eliminate current jobs, new jobs will be created as the technology and vehicles need to be created and assembled.  But the backlash coming from society could be drastic for the industry as many ethics come into play, questions such as: Will it make the right decisions? Is it trustworthy? Is it safe? What happens if it makes its own decisions?  </p>
	<h2> How will this affect you?</h2>
	<p>Fully autonomous vehicles will affect my daily life due to the fact of how often I use transportation to reach university and other locations. If all vehicles such as buses, trains and cars become autonomous it would affect the way I travel. Having cars and trains that are autonomous may affect the time taken for me to travel to various locations, the reduce traffic congestion and possible human error on trains would allow for a smooth experience. This would also affect how driver licences are acquired when the car can already drive itself, so then getting a licence would become irrelevant. But this change would occur in the far future. The way people would act on the roads would be different, people, including myself would be much more cautious due to the fact that a human isn't in control of the car.  </p>
