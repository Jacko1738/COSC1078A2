Luke:  Hey! the name is Luke Baker; my friends refer to me as Baker but both are fine. I'm a first year Uni student and graduated from high school last year. I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because of the facilities and opportunities RMIT has to offer and feedback I heard from former students I also gained an interest in IT in my last year of high school while studying computing seeing that the future is tech. In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching basketball and footy, hanging out with friends and watching videos or series 
</p>
	
<p> Luke: For my test, the 16 personalities test I received the result of “Mediator” with scores of 58% Intorverted, 52% Intuitive, 62% Feeling, 56% Prospecting and 69% Turbulent. From the second test I took I found out that I am a 40% Auditory learner, a 35% Visual Learner and a 25% Tactile Learner. For the third test I conducted the Dr. Phil Personality test and got the result of ‘The loyal friend’ with the main results being that people view me as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. A not so common response is that I’m clever, gifted, talented but modest. </p>
	
<p> Ethan: My name is Ethan lock; my student number is s3899728. I came from St Francis Xavier high school and have always loved being on computers hence why the course I chose was a Bachelor of IT.  I love playing computer games and currently play Valorant semi-professionally for Kingsmen. My major interest in IT would be programming as I love to create shortcuts that make tedious jobs easier for myself and others. I can achieve this using programming. I also like idea of being a cyber securest, this is another major interest that I have in IT as I want it to be my job later in the future. My IT Experience only consist of programming classes in high school. I did year 10-12 and now started University learning programming as well. I have many friends that also know how to program so they used to teach me certain languages as they knew that I wanted to learn how to code in multiple languages. </p>
	
<p> Ethan: For my test the 16 personalities test I achieved “The Virtuoso” I had 65% introverted, 67% observant, 59% thinking, 57% Prospecting, 61% Turbulent.  From the Education planer I discovered I'm an auditory learner at 40%, a visual learner at 25% and tactile 35%. For the third test I did a open psychometrics test and gained scores at extroversion 41, emotional stability 39, agreeableness 14, conscientiousness 26 and intellect/imagination at 3. Through these test shows that i learn easier by listening and that a major part of my personalities is being able to be observant and a critical thinker. </p>
