Luke:  Hey! the name is Luke Baker; my friends refer to me as Baker but both are fine. I'm a first year Uni student and graduated from high school last year. I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because of the facilities and opportunities RMIT has to offer and feedback I heard from former students I also gained an interest in IT in my last year of high school while studying computing seeing that the future is tech. In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching basketball and footy, hanging out with friends and watching videos or series

<p> Luke: For my test, the 16 personalities test I received the result of “Mediator” with scores of 58% Intorverted, 52% Intuitive, 62% Feeling, 56% Prospecting and 69% Turbulent. From the second test I took I found out that I am a 40% Auditory learner, a 35% Visual Learner and a 25% Tactile Learner. For the third test I conducted the Dr. Phil Personality test and got the result of ‘The loyal friend’ with the main results being that people view me as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. A not so common response is that I’m clever, gifted, talented but modest. </p>
