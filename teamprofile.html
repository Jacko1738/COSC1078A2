Luke:  Hey! the name is Luke Baker; my friends refer to me as Baker but both are fine. I'm a first year Uni student and graduated from high school last year. I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because of the facilities and opportunities RMIT has to offer and feedback I heard from former students I also gained an interest in IT in my last year of high school while studying computing seeing that the future is tech. In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching basketball and footy, hanging out with friends and watching videos or series

For the third test I conducted the Dr. Phil Personality test and got the result of ‘The loyal friend’ with the main results being that people view me as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. A not so common response is that I’m clever, gifted, talented but modest. </p>

My major interest in IT would be programming as I love to create shortcuts that make tedious jobs easier for myself and others. I can achieve this using programming. I also like idea of being a cyber securest, this is another major interest that I have in IT as I want it to be my job later in the future. My IT Experience only consist of programming classes in high school. I did year 10-12 and now started University learning programming as well. I have many friends that also know how to program so they used to teach me certain languages as they knew that I wanted to learn how to code in multiple languages. </p>

For the third test I did a open psychometrics test and gained scores at extroversion 41, emotional stability 39, agreeableness 14, conscientiousness 26 and intellect/imagination at 3.
