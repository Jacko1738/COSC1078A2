Our project will be tested throughout the entire process of creating it by the members of the group and carefully selected individuals elsewhere. This is done to help identify any issues or flaws that occur and highlight any room for improvement. During our project we are also developing menus with the help of Figma, this will be used to visualise how the menu of the game will function. Once the project begins to reach its final stage of development, we will gather individuals to conduct user testing. The individuals that will be acquired will need to have different amounts of experience with aim trainers, gaming and FPS shooters. This is done so we can ensure no matter the level of expertise the user has it can be used by all types of users ranging from beginners to experts. For some individuals they will be told to just use the game and get themselves familiar with each of its features and functions. Others will be told to do certain tasks such as “Change the FOV” or “Launch a game on XYZ mode”. This will help discover if the game is easy to use. The main reasoning behind user testing is to get a grasp on how well the game interacts with the demographic that will be using the game, when members in the group test the game, they may tend to miss small complications since they were involved in the creation of the game it may just seem a simple task when it isn’t.
