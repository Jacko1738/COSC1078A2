Within our group the roles were divided up to help produce a suitable prototype. Jack would be the lead developer. He oversaw organising the physical prototype of the game. This indicates to potential users what would be offered within the game. Luke and Ethan both focused on the user interface design. These designs depict the way to each section of the game. This could be the training section, competitive section, custom matches or the settings. It helps indicate to the user the total limitation of the menu pages. Teng and Mitchel focus is researching about the game. They explain through multiple sources how a game like this could be beneficial to the users. Finally, Dylan has had a input on the research however he is working on the presentation section. Making sure that the final report is presentable to help show viewers and support the product.
