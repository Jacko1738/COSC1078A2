<h1> Project Idea </h1>

<div id="bodytext"
<p> Our group’s project idea consists of a 1v1 and aim-trainer game that helps accurately replicate the feel of other games (CS-GO, Valorant, Rainbow-Six Siege, Fortnite) to give the user the best way to improve their skills. The 1v1 aspect will consist of a cycling arena to keep players constantly thinking about player and crosshair placement. This mode will consist of a ranking system, so you are put against people with the same skill as you and encourage the player to improve. During the game search, you can play the aim-trainer modes without leaving que and change game options such as the type of guns from the type of game you would like to use.    </p>
	<p> Other aim trainer games do not have a clear leader board and does not rank compared to other players like this project idea could. They rank based on how many targets are shot or the percentage of accuracy. Our project idea will rank people based on how well they perform during the 1v1 games through an elo system like the ones used in Valorant and League of Legends. Where one match is close (10-8) the person who won will not be awarded as many elo points and the person who lost won't lose as many elo points but for a match where someone clearly wins (10-2) the winner is awarded more elo and loser loses a lot of elo. This ranking system will allow you to see who the best aimer is (being good a clicking dots is not a good representation of how good your aim will be in game compare to the real game scenarios like in this project idea)  </p>
	<p>1v1: Consists of an arena that changes every round (between 5-10 maps). First to 10 kills wins for ranked and 5 kills for unranked. Options will consist of:  </p>
	<ul>
  <li>Changing between ranked and unranked. </li>
  <li>Change the game movement / guns (Fortnite: third person, jumping does not affect recoil CS-GO: first person, jumping and moving affects recoil, etc.) – choosing Valorant will have vandal, phantom, CS-GO will have ak-47, M4A1, etc. </li>
  <li>Set free guns (choose any gun) or a set gun. </li>
</ul>
	<p>The aim-training game modes will consist of a reaction speed test, aim endurance test, and range to build the proper muscle memory needed for better aim where reaction speed and aim endurance tests can be played with another person via an invite (A friend) this can be done through a code (Like among us) or a direct invite through a service like steam. These modes will have options to change the difficulty – the size of the target, the time between targets showing, how far the target can spawn from your crosshair, etc.   </p>
	<p>Reaction speed test: To be closer to a real scenario instead of having a square that turns green having a corner you are looking at and have a bot step out. This will record reaction time but also teach the player to have their cursor at head level.  </p>
	<p>Aim endurance test: A series of spheres or dots will appear where the player is to shoot them in as little time as possible. After one is shot another one appears and has a time limit of around 30 seconds. This also builds muscle memory for ‘flicks’ (quick aim movement) and tests the player's accuracy as it will show how many shots were missed.  </p>
	<p>  Range: The range is an area where the player can test different guns from different games and get used to their control patterns, range drop off, how player movement affects recoil, etc.  </p>
	<p>Another big aspect of our project idea is to feature a well-rounded mouse sensitivity calculator. As gamers, we know how difficult it is to get the exact sensitivity for every game we have. Having a perfect sensitivity is the difference between a headshot or a miss. On startup, the game will have a scene where you go throw a few tests and are able to adjust sensitivity to your liking. Once you are done you will be able to search up what sensitivity you will need to set in all your favorite games to achieve the same sensitivity.  </p>
	<p> As games like CS-GO and Valorant make most of their money through in game skins for guns this would be one concept we bring into our project idea to make money. However, people are meant to use our game as a warmup / training for these games, so it makes more sense to not think of skins as our main income. Our project will still consist of skins that you will be able to purchase with in game money earned by doing achievements (play 10 aim endurance test) and have the option to buy with real money if they wanted to. So, the main profit for the project will be the initial cost to play compared to the cost of skins / in game currencies.   </p>
	<p>Tools that are required to make this project idea can incorporate common game engines like Unity, Unreal engine, or AnvilNext. These engines have been used to create popular games (Rainbow-Six Siege) and similar games to our project ideas (aim lab). These game engines provide a great framework to start making progress on a project idea such as ours. These engines consist of drag and drop variables to game objects to make easy levels and uses well know programming languages such as C# and Java. Most game engines are well optimized making it easy to make and run your own games. You should be able to run on most desktops and higher end laptops. Making this project also requires a group meaning a Git system will be used. Github is always the go to and will be what we would use to collaborate on this project.  </p>
	<p> On completion of this project idea, people can improve their aim and easily transfer their skill into multiple games using the sensitivity calculator. The ranking system allows the player to know that they are improving and gives them the motivation to get better and train their aim. Being able to verse their friends in the training modes allows them to compare their levels of aim and adds competitiveness which also boosts their motivation in training their aim. </p>
