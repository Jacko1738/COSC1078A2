<h1> Project Idea </h1>

<div id="bodytext"
<p> Our group’s project idea consists of a 1v1 and aim-trainer game that helps accurately replicate the feel of other games (CS-GO, Valorant, Rainbow-Six Siege, Fortnite) to give the user the best way to improve their skills. The 1v1 aspect will consist of a cycling arena to keep players constantly thinking about player and crosshair placement. This mode will consist of a ranking system, so you are put against people with the same skill as you and encourage the player to improve. During the game search, you can play the aim-trainer modes without leaving que and change game options such as the type of guns from the type of game you would like to use.    </p>
	<p> Other aim trainer games do not have a clear leader board and does not rank compared to other players like this project idea could. They rank based on how many targets are shot or the percentage of accuracy. Our project idea will rank people based on how well they perform during the 1v1 games through an elo system like the ones used in Valorant and League of Legends. Where one match is close (10-8) the person who won will not be awarded as many elo points and the person who lost won't lose as many elo points but for a match where someone clearly wins (10-2) the winner is awarded more elo and loser loses a lot of elo. This ranking system will allow you to see who the best aimer is (being good a clicking dots is not a good representation of how good your aim will be in game compare to the real game scenarios like in this project idea)  </p>
	<p>1v1: Consists of an arena that changes every round (between 5-10 maps). First to 10 kills wins for ranked and 5 kills for unranked. Options will consist of:  </p>
	<ul>
  <li>Changing between ranked and unranked. </li>
  <li>Change the game movement / guns (Fortnite: third person, jumping does not affect recoil CS-GO: first person, jumping and moving affects recoil, etc.) – choosing Valorant will have vandal, phantom, CS-GO will have ak-47, M4A1, etc. </li>
  <li>Set free guns (choose any gun) or a set gun. </li>
</ul>
