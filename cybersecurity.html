     <h2> What does it do?</h2>
<p> Cyber security specialist is especially important in everyday lives. They protect people when they do not even mean too, and they protect organizations as well. Cyber securities stop “data breaches, cyber-attacks or ransomware.” (1) if an organisation were to lose their data to a cybercriminal it could result in people's identity being stolen to money being stolen. Attacks like these can ruin people's life and a cyber security prevents situations like these by happening. Since the problem stems from an issue within the organization this is where they are placed. Jobs roles within this field can range from “information security office, security administrator, cyber security consultant, cyber security analyst, penetration tester. (1)” Jobs such as a penetration tester pretends to hack into the system with malicious intent to decide if the software will react and defend the data in the way that it supposed to. People in this type of job need to keep on learning as Techology advances. This is due to the fact cyber criminals are always creating new ways and new methods to hack into a system, if the system is not ready for this, data will be lost. Adobe an excessively big company had fallen to a breach of data. Their whole database was hacked and the “hackers stolen nearly 3 million encrypted customer credit cards. This was due to a lack of understanding of future developments in cyber criminals' methods leaving adobe $1.1 million in legal fees (2). Therefore, cybersecurity is such an important job to the world since everyone's information is left online and in databases jobs that protect this can be lifesaving. Recently 5 trends have formed that help advance cyber protection. These advancements are "broader solutions,” “AI (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning, “IoT (Internet of Thing) protection,” “password (not) only authentication,” “permissions requirements. (3) “Under broader solutions a system needs to be created that can detect and remove any type of malware, this is since “anti-malware vendors have determined that millions of malware programs are created each month (3)”. Having a broader solution that removes malware out completely would be much more effective. Under Ai and machine learning a machine is being used to study and find malicious behaviour from hackers, this is done through the “modelling network behaviour” (3). The machine does all the studying and learning and provides the designers with information to predict and prepare for future cyber security threats. Under IoT protection will try to reduce the amount of botnet attacks. Botnet attacks are several bots connected to each other that can be used to “perform a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) (Distributed denial-of-services”. This has become the focus of corporations like Microsoft to help reduce the number of botnets that exist/ can be buying with ease. If the number of botnets is decrease or difficulty of them increase can help reduce the number of botnets. Under password (not) only authentication, is to phase passwords with words with a capital and a number. This would be replaced with multifactor authentication and risk-based authentication. Lastly under permission requirements old local administrator privileges will be phased out. This will be introduced with a system that can allow certain users and “admins to have full access to applications. “(3). With these 5 trends in place can help improve cyber security making it less likely for a hacker to steal key information about you from a data base   </p>
	<h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>
	<p> In this era when everyone is using mobile phones and computers, cybersecurity has become very important. Sometimes we upload personal information to the Internet, such as online shopping, making doctor appointment, buying movie tickets and so on. This data is very important because no one wants to receive spam or harassment calls every day. The most important thing is your personal payment information. You do not want your bank card to be used by others. At the same time, cybersecurity is also to prevent hackers from intruding. It is hard to imagine what the world will be like if hackers control the banks or the launch permissions of nuclear bombs. That is why your computer is constantly being told that there are system updates. Large enterprises constantly upgrade their firewalls and security systems to their servers. In short, cybersecurity affects our lives. </p>
	<h2> How will this affect you?
	<p> As I said above, everyone's information on the network is a piece of data. Network security ensures that all our information and data will not be used by bad people. At the same time, it also reminds us not to upload our personal information and send it to strangers. 	</p>
