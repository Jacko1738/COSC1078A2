<h2> What does it do? </h2>
<p> When people think of robots, they picture a “metallic human looking” object capable of doing certain tasks, such as walking and talking.  Truth is, robots come in different sizes, some as small as a coin, and others bigger than a car. Issac Asimov famously created the 3 rules of robotics, them being: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings expect where such orders would conflict with the first law and 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second laws. The extent of their capabilities also vary, some performing simple, monotonous, and repetitive tasks, while others are tools that help physicians perform delicate surgeries. Robots are autonomous machines programmed to be capable of sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and to perform actions. Robots have three main components; Sensors (for input), CPU (for processing) and Mechanics (for output).  To sense its environment, robots can be fitted with devices such as cameras and sensors.   To enable a robot to compute, it can be fitted with a small electronic circuit, a powerful multicore processor or even be connected to a cluster of networked computers. The range of actions that a robot can perform can be as simple as moving from one point to another, manipulating things, some can both move and manipulate, some are designed to perform one specific task, where some are designed to perform multiple complex tasks. Robots are built to help us and make our lives easier. </p>

<p> When looking at the future of robot development, some of the key points are to increase the performance of the robot, to reduce the cost to make and run the robot, and the ability to expand and introduce new functionalities of the robot. Today, some examples of development areas being looked at, especially in the manufacturing industry, are multi robot control, safe control, force control, 3D vision, remote robot supervision and wireless communication.
Multi robot control allows the possibility to reduce production costs by having robots working in parallel that can be controlled from one controller, which means floor space can be saved, and collision avoidance performance improved. 3D vision developments improve on the 1D and 2D vision capabilities by allowing the robot to be more precise with measurements, and to perceive depth and shapes.  </p>
	
<p> One new development being designed to help visually impaired people, is the “robotic guide dog. This robot, designed by Anthony Camu, a student at Loughborough University, caters for those that cannot look after a live guide dog or may not have the space to house one. The robot is designed to replicate a guide dog and has features such as programming safe and quick routes to destination by using real-time data. Similarly, another state of the art robot is the Boston Dynamics robot dog named Spot. Boston Dynamics has shown us on multiple occasions that this new age robot is capable of walking and acting like a real life dog. It can trot along through any place without crashing into objects, it can also climb up and down flights of stairs and even open doors when it is equipped with an attachable robot hand. Boston Dynamics has explained that it now envisions for Spot to act as a helper robot which can record and stream footage and also carry packages. The company has come out and said that a construction firm has saved over 20 hours of work per week by using their robot dog to capture images of their future building projects. Boston Dynamics have reported other use cases involving sending the robot dog to scout and monitor hazardous environments for humans such as a decommissioned nuclear site, factory floors and even crime scenes. Boston Dynamics released the bot to the police in Massachusetts to act as a scout which stirred up the question whether robot dogs will one day be used in law enforcement. Spot is a wi-fi capable robot that will be ready to operate as soon as it comes out of the box and has a battery that lasts 90 minutes on a single charge. With the dog, the customer will also receive a tablet controller which can order Spot to perform certain tasks the customer would like. With the technology used to make spot, it allows for more customisation as you can program spot through the machines API to do almost anything you would like.</p>
	
	
	
<h2> What is the likely impact?  </h2>
<p> By 2020, people had predicted that roughly more than 5 million jobs will be stolen by robots. This will pose a huge robotic threat to the economy. But if we look at the time now, many jobs have already been stolen. Many manual labours and other simple tasks are mostly completed by robots and machines.
As we have seen, Robots are becoming more and more advanced, user friendly and accessible to all people. With a widespread of robots encompassing all of our everyday lives, but not only does it make our work more efficient, its also cost saving in the long scheme of things. While the use of robots in our daily life’s spark a lot of controversy in the working society, it is undeniable that the use of robots overall brings more good than harms. </p>
	
<p> Some of these positive impacts that we may experience in our daily lives can consist of:

•	Increasing Work efficiency and Productivity
Robots are here to carry out the impossible tasks on behalf of the human workers. This can be due to robots being more precise and more versatile than human workers. Because of this, there is a lower failure rate, it also increases the production and profit margin in conjunction to it’s speed and efficiency.

•	It will promote skilled workers.
With the implementation of robots in the working society can mean that there will be lesser repetitive jobs in the future. While we all know that it undeniably reduces job opportunities, but ultimately it drives the future of the workforce to pick up and learn new skills in order for them to stay competitive in the job market.  </p>
	
<p> Some of these Negative impacts that we may experience in our daily lives can consist of:

•	Anxiety and Insecurity regarding the future.
With the loss of employment due to the workplaces slowly becoming more automated, it has become a big concern for a growing number of today’s workers and professionals. Automations promises to be nothing short of a revolution, it may be one that is just as significant as the Industrial Revolution of the 19th Century. The anxiety and insecurity that is being caused by this drastic and sweeping change is not something that should be taken lightly. </p>
	
<h2> How will this affect you? </h2>
	
<p> The main way that robots will affect me and my family will be that the future of business may be robots. Robots are replacing some human jobs and many processes are becoming more efficient with the help of robots. Although robots are most commonly integrated into the manufacturing processes of large corporations, by doing this they can increase the output and productivity while keeping labour costs down and improving reliability in manufacturing by removing human error. AS automation advances, a growing number of smaller businesses will start using robots as a way to improve their own processes. This will have a significant impact on the human labour force ultimately making humans obsolete to robots in the work force. </p>
	
<p> Ultimately, with the high demand of all these robots to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of businesses, the robots will have to be made and programmed to be able to complete these specific requests. The field of robotics will create so many jobs for humans to be able to still be working and have a chance at life how they knew it before robots. Luckily for me, robotics is something I’ve been very interested in for a couple of years so it may not be all bad for me and may not have as big of an effect as it will for others in different areas of the workforce. The high demand of workers needed to supply the world with these robots will be significant creating opportunities to those in the IT field and others who are willing to apply themselves to the IT and Robotics fields. </p>
