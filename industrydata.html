<p>HAS OUR OPINION CHANGED FOR OUR IDEAL JOBS?  </p>
	<p>Jack: My opinion on my ideal job has not changed. After looking through the burning glass data it ensured me that I have a strong carrier path and that the type of occupation is well received in the technology industry. All sought over skills display what I enjoy (problem solving, teamwork, advanced programming) therefore I have no reason to think why a software engineer would not be my ideal job. </p>
	<p>Luke: No, my opinion has not changed much, if anything it has made me more interested and invested in the IT systems Engineer career. Since there are a lot of people trying to do the job, it will create more competition which will fuel my eager and excitement to take on the challenge and succeed. I feel as if my skillset will be enough to succeed in the job, I would like to peruse after completing my degree.  </p>
	<p>Ethan: No, my opinion has not been changed for the ideal job. Although there will be more contest to achieve the job, I would prefer as it is suited towards my own skillset. In my ideal job I would go through all if not most of the general skills required. This can help me develop as a person as they are all very important aspects of a job. The only issue with my ideal job would most likely be the lack of IT specific skills. Judging by how the Its specific skills are currently not in as much demand as other IT specific skills.   </p>
	<p>Tenghui: My idea has not changed, I will still choose to become a software engineer, because this is my idea all the time, and has not changed. I hope to make interesting and practical applications for people, and I also believe that the possibility of information technology will be greater and greater in the future. </p>
	<p>Dylan: My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. Although my field of interest for an ideal job is not on top of the list, I still find the management of people and projects extremely relevant within the field of IT. Jobs including large amount of programming continue to be the jobs that are in demand and tend to be popular within the IT industry. What the data did demonstrate is the high demand for communication and problem-solving skills which I believe is very relevant in my ideal job.  </p>
	<p>Mitchell: No, a major aspect of my desired job is qualities such as freedom and autonomy rather the specific qualities required. Even in this case the most relevant skills tend to correlate as knowledge in SQL and Scripting Languages are necessary and interpersonal skills such as communication as well as analytic skills such as problem-solving are vital to effectively perform the tasks of an ethical hacker.   </p>
