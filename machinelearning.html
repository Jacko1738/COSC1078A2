     <h2> What does it do?</h2>
<p> Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves creating a system capable of parsing data using algorithms to make future predictions. This system can also be designed to automatically develop without human intervention and refine its future predictions. Four main categories of Machine Learning are Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Semi-Supervised Machine Learning and Reinforcement Machine Learning. Supervised Machine Learning involves a system or model developing itself with a labelled data set, a collection of information that outlines the way in which the system is intended to classify data. This method requires less training data than other learning methods and is easier as the model results can be compared to the labelled data. One downside is that preparing labelled data can be expensive. However, a larger issue is that the model could become biased towards the data it is provided during training, preventing it from processing new or varied data as well. Unsupervised Machine Learning involves providing the model a collection of unlabelled data and using algorithms to extract significant and relevant information while identifying patterns and relationships within the data provided, all without human intervention. An example would be spam detection where large volumes of data within emails can be examined to identify features consistent within spam emails which also serves as an excellent scenario for development. As the name suggests, Semi-Supervised Learning draws aspects from both categories. During training a smaller data set is used to assist with classification as well as retrieval of relevant information from larger data sets. This category can also assist with a lack of labelled data for training a supervised model. Reinforcement Machine Learning involves interactions with an external environment performing actions to determine the cause and effect of each action to derive possible benefits and errors. This allows systems to identify the most ideal action within a certain context to maximise performance and efficiency. Reward feedback is required for the system to ascertain the “correct” action and is therefore known as the reinforcement signal. Machine learning can be observed within digital assistants such as Cortana and Siri which use NLP (Natural Language Processing), a machine learning system that processes text and speech to further refine itself. Other examples include chatbots which use pattern recognition and NLP to assess text and respond as well as recommendation algorithms such as within YouTube, using deep learning (a subset of machine learning that improve neural networks by subjecting them to large collections of data) models to recognise patterns and make suggestions based on that data. Many applications of machine learning contribute to ease of access and overall convenience, especially during online interactions. The main factors that have contributed to the development within this area of technology include the vast amounts of data available including but not limited to; text; speech; video and images, as well as the processing power available within modern technology such as within graphic processing units (GPUs). Personalisation at an individual level is only expected to increase within online entertainment and shopping as each interaction with online services reveals more data about an individual, allowing recommendation systems to become more refined and accurate. The future significance of AI and by extension Machine Learning can be summarised in a quote from Mark Cuban, “Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you’re doing if you don’t understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you’re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.” Another aspect to examine is the future net worth of Machine Learning as it has been projected that the Machine Learning market income will rise from one billion to nine billion USD by 2022 as predicted by Market and Markets, a firm that conducts research that identifies opportunities and threats to the revenues of worldwide companies.  </p>
