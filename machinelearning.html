     <h2> What does it do?</h2>
<p> Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves creating a system capable of parsing data using algorithms to make future predictions. This system can also be designed to automatically develop without human intervention and refine its future predictions. Four main categories of Machine Learning are Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Semi-Supervised Machine Learning and Reinforcement Machine Learning. Supervised Machine Learning involves a system or model developing itself with a labelled data set, a collection of information that outlines the way in which the system is intended to classify data. This method requires less training data than other learning methods and is easier as the model results can be compared to the labelled data. One downside is that preparing labelled data can be expensive. However, a larger issue is that the model could become biased towards the data it is provided during training, preventing it from processing new or varied data as well. Unsupervised Machine Learning involves providing the model a collection of unlabelled data and using algorithms to extract significant and relevant information while identifying patterns and relationships within the data provided, all without human intervention. An example would be spam detection where large volumes of data within emails can be examined to identify features consistent within spam emails which also serves as an excellent scenario for development. As the name suggests, Semi-Supervised Learning draws aspects from both categories. During training a smaller data set is used to assist with classification as well as retrieval of relevant information from larger data sets. This category can also assist with a lack of labelled data for training a supervised model. Reinforcement Machine Learning involves interactions with an external environment performing actions to determine the cause and effect of each action to derive possible benefits and errors. This allows systems to identify the most ideal action within a certain context to maximise performance and efficiency. Reward feedback is required for the system to ascertain the “correct” action and is therefore known as the reinforcement signal. Machine learning can be observed within digital assistants such as Cortana and Siri which use NLP (Natural Language Processing), a machine learning system that processes text and speech to further refine itself. Other examples include chatbots which use pattern recognition and NLP to assess text and respond as well as recommendation algorithms such as within YouTube, using deep learning (a subset of machine learning that improve neural networks by subjecting them to large collections of data) models to recognise patterns and make suggestions based on that data. Many applications of machine learning contribute to ease of access and overall convenience, especially during online interactions. The main factors that have contributed to the development within this area of technology include the vast amounts of data available including but not limited to; text; speech; video and images, as well as the processing power available within modern technology such as within graphic processing units (GPUs). Personalisation at an individual level is only expected to increase within online entertainment and shopping as each interaction with online services reveals more data about an individual, allowing recommendation systems to become more refined and accurate. The future significance of AI and by extension Machine Learning can be summarised in a quote from Mark Cuban, “Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you’re doing if you don’t understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you’re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.” Another aspect to examine is the future net worth of Machine Learning as it has been projected that the Machine Learning market income will rise from one billion to nine billion USD by 2022 as predicted by Market and Markets, a firm that conducts research that identifies opportunities and threats to the revenues of worldwide companies.  </p>
<h2> What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p> This technology has the potential to make an impact on a global scale with its influence extending further into various industries such as Retail and Financial while bolstering itself within the context of IT. An example would be the healthcare industry where Machine Learning already has a foothold in medical image analysis. This area has provided more data for supporting diagnoses and allowed for instances of human error in perceiving this data to be easier identified. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and other deep learning models have been successful in retrieving relevant information such as medical images to support correct diagnoses. Machine Learning will also continue to hold relevance in interconnected areas of IT such as Cybersecurity where systems can be used to extract information from incident reports and alerts to identify potential threats, increase response time and advise security analysts. One of the more obvious impacts is the possibility of automation which can reduce the need for human labour and the performance of menial and repetitive tasks. This automation has already been implemented in the form of recommendation systems where algorithms examine data and then provide a recommendation, a task far better suited for a machine than a human. Although at face value it appears that AI and by extension Machine Learning has the potential to make many jobs redundant, it also has the potential to create many more as it was projected by Gartner Inc that AI would eliminate 1.8 million jobs and create 2.3 million more by the end of 2020. Another area where Machine Learning will become invaluable is self-driving cars. This technology involves continuously identifying objects within a car’s external environment and establishing future predictions about how these objects will move or change to guide the car. This process involves not only several machine learning processes but also several deep learning algorithms. </p>
	<h2> How will this affect you?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning will have a direct impact on not only online interactions at an individual level, but also at a societal level. The development of Machine Learning will more than likely have a direct impact on the future careers for any individuals involved in an Information Technology degree, whether that be basic or specialised as those individuals are more than likely slated to establish a career within the IT industry. The presence of digital assistants, recommendation applications, online advertising and chatbots can form a large portion of an online experience and as such the development of Machine Learning can and will have a direct impact on the online interactions for anyone. For example, within online advertising, the more information about a user’s habits and preferences that can be ascertained and interpreted by a system, the more accurate and refined these subsequent recommendations will become. The Healthcare industry is extremely important at an individual and societal level which Machine Learning has the potential to revolutionise and improve upon its pre-existing foundations. These developments all have the potential to streamline an individual’s everyday life, improving overall convenience thanks to digital assistants and the potential to improve resource management such as time and money through the automation of processes such as recommendations and chatbots. Online browsing has the potential to become significantly safer when examining pre-existing services such as spam and fraud detection, the development of the latter would especially contribute to an overall safer online experience if combined with browsing services and search engines for example. Development within self-driving cars could contribute towards a safer and more convenient road experience especially for individuals who can’t or don’t have the opportunity to learn to drive whilst also holding significant potential within development in other sectors of transport such as by train or by air.  </p>
