     <p> The IT professional that was interviewed was <strong> Jon Carracher </strong> </p>


<p> Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? I am a manager engineer of an IT team that looks after the full life cycle of development though to the production stage. I give support in the integration of data power. </p>

<p> Please tell us about the industry you work in. NAB banking industry. Baking industry runs on old tech 60 and 70s mainframes as core end systems. Working in cloud services. Highly secure extremely high available </p>

<p> What other kinds of work do you have to do? Other kinds of work I work in would be project management, personal (team manager) engagement with other technology with banking management, financials, getting involved in defining full technology cycle, responsible for ensuring standards right through building stage to implementation stage. SLAâ€™s incident management.  </p>

<p> Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. I continuously swap project but currently the project I am working on. Requires interaction with enterprise architecture, project architecture, within team design and Developmnent testing, chain managing teams, work with test teams within the project space to ensure we deliver what is needed. Ultimately working with others technology stacks such aa mainframe team, mini ap team, others infrastructure, loan banking and finally Layers of management working with CIO.  </p>

<p> Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. Since I oversee the project, I have the pleasure of talking with multiple teams. If I am working with architect, it would be an argumentative relationship because they may push for something that is not practical, this can lead to negotiations with them. With management engineers or other developers, the relationship is more respectful this is because they are less likely to push on ideas that may be impractical and are mutually independent. In production support providing customer services to NAB work very collaboratively with other IT developers.  </p>

<p> What about your interactions with clients or investors? For us, that main problem would be the people who are funding the project. They will come to us saying they need this feature then we will provide them with order of magnitude estimate. We then provide the customer with how long it will take and the period we can do it. As an internal IIT the project, NAB is our clients or investors.  </p>

<p> What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. Due to being a manger its different for me. I spend most of my time observing projects or customer services. Any other person apart of my team they will say they spend most of their time on developing. For me it is more meetings and various levels of management.  </p>

<p> Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? Bureaucracy would be the most challenging aspect. Not the technology. The Red tape is the most inefficient processes. Red tape is when you need to get approvement from lots of services. A heavy process overhead. For example, a 1-hour job cold take a minimum of 4 hours of changes of approval. Deployment of changes will run for several hours the testing business testing. Sign offs and documentation. It is 1 -2 days effort for 5 mins to one hour of developing. This is difference for private firms are different as it can just happen straight away. </p> 

<p> Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? z/OS connect for IBM. I am working on a project to deliver into NABs current archaic mainframe stack. The purpose of that is to expose the APIs services. Allowing them to have direct access to the data. The project itself is in the infrastructure stag and application stage, implementation, and development services. The project is there to be consumed by other developers in the technology industry. I am running a project that involves every aspect of the technology space. I get to work with everyone across the spectrum.   </p>
