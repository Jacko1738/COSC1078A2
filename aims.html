The aim of sharpshooters is to help teach newer players the muscle memory to aiming and allowing them to compete against others. Many players use aim trainers to help improve their aim and many of the players at higher ranks tend to wonder who the best aimer is. Sharpshooters will allow the players to compete against each other either against friends or in ranked to find out who is the best aimer for a certain type of game.
