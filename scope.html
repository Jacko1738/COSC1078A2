Due to the limited time, although we very much hope to add more functions, settings and maps to the game, it will make the workload become very large. One drawback of our game is that we can't completely recover FPS game content. It means that our project is difficult to restore the recoil and artillery model in other FPS games, and there is no gun shooting sound effect in our game, which may make players feel monotonous and lack of interest in the game. So, through group discussion, we finally decided to keep the most practical features and settings.
